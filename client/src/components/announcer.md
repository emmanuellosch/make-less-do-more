# Announcer

This is a documentation about the Announcer-Component. Whenever the message changes in the Announcer component of the app's searchbar screen readers will read out the message.

Now, as you search, screen reader users will receive an update letting them know how many posts are on the page.

```jsx
<Announcer message="3 recipes" />
```
