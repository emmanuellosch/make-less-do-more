    title: "Zero Waste - Beeswax swaps",
    author: "Emmanuel",

    subtle:
      "Have you used beeswax wraps before? They’re nifty little things. We use them all the time! Beeswax wraps are a sustainable alternative to plastic cling wrap, and a great way to reduce plastic waste in the kitchen. Even better, it’s incredibly easy to make your own homemade beeswax wraps!",
    supplies: [
      "100% cotton fabric or muslin, (organic if possible), washed and ironed",
      "Pure beeswax (100g)",
      "Jojoba oil (10g), For its antibacterial qualities",
      "Coconut or almond oil (10g, to make the fabric more pliable)",
      "Pine resin, powdered (70g)",
      "Clean brush with thin bristles",
      "Baking parchment",
      "Baking tray",
      "Drying rack",
    ],

    steps: [
      "Cut your pre-washed fabric to the size you want using pinking shears (to prevent fraying). A thin, fine-weave cotton is best, as it is easier to fold and wrap when infused with wax; muslin or sheet-thickness is ideal. The beeswax will turn your fabric slightly yellow, so choose a colour that won’t clash.",
      "Put the pine resin (if in chunks, roll it with a rolling pin to turn it to powder) in a metal bowl and place over a pan of simmering water. When the resin starts to melt, add the beeswax, almond or coconut oil and jojoba. When the ingredients have melted, mix together gently, keeping the pan on a low heat.",
      "Heat your oven to 140°C. Lay the fabric on a baking sheet covered with baking paper, making sure the paper is bigger than your fabric. If you’re making a large wrap, for storing bread for example, it’s okay to fold the fabric so it fits on your baking sheet. Place in the oven for two minutes to heat the fabric.",
      "Take the tray out of the oven and, working quickly, use your brush to paint the fabric with the beeswax mix. Return to the oven for a minute, then remove and brush again to ensure the wax is spread evenly all over the cotton. Use pegs or just drape the fabric on a rack to dry; it will take only minutes.",
      "Your wrap is then ready to use. Use the warmth of your hands to shape it around a bowl, jar or sandwich. Don’t use your wrap to cover raw fish, eggs or meat. Clean it with a cloth using cold-to-warm water – hot will melt the wax – and a little detergent; rinse and hang to dry. If it needs a refresh after a few months, place on a lined tray in a 140°C oven for three minutes. ",

    title: "Zero Waste - Coffee",
    author: "Thomas",
    subtle:
      "For you over caffeinated coffee addicts out there, time to toss the coffee pods! Turn that vice into a virtue by making zero waste coffee.",
    supplies: [
      "Start by buying your coffee in bulk.  You can typically either grind right there at the store (we tried 3 stores before we found one with a grinder so it may take a bit of perseverance) or do it yourself at home for an ultra-fresh brew – guaranteed maximum deliciousness!",
    ],
    steps: [
      "To make the coffee itself, you can either use a glass / stainless steel french press, or an Italian Bialetti stovetop espresso maker. We personally LOVE the Bialetti, we’ve been using for years and love the routine of making it on the stove, is a special little morning routine! Once you’re finished, just toss the grounds into your compost bin or even directly in soil as a pH neutral fertilizer and natural pesticide. Worms love coffee grounds too!",

    title: "Zero Waste - Kitchen Cleaning",
    author: "Rachel",
    subtle:
      "Just because you’ve gone zero waste and avoid plastic bottles with chemical based household cleaners, doesn’t mean you can’t keep your kitchen sparkly clean. ",
    supplies: [
      "To wash dishes, ditch the plastic bottle and switch to zero waste dish soap. Alternatively, you can opt for zero waste bulk soap, which you can now find at many grocery stores.",
    ],
    steps: [
      "Lastly, to keep countertops clean and bacteria free with a simple, all-purpose zero waste cleaner you can make out of just vinegar diluted with water. ",
