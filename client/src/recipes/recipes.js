    title: "Zero Waste - Beeswax swaps",
    author: "Emmanuel",

    subtle:
      "Have you used beeswax wraps before? They’re nifty little things. We use them all the time! Beeswax wraps are a sustainable alternative to plastic cling wrap, and a great way to reduce plastic waste in the kitchen. Even better, it’s incredibly easy to make your own homemade beeswax wraps!",
    supplies: [
      "100% cotton fabric or muslin, (organic if possible), washed and ironed",
      "Pure beeswax (100g)",
      "Jojoba oil (10g), For its antibacterial qualities",
      "Coconut or almond oil (10g, to make the fabric more pliable)",
      "Pine resin, powdered (70g)",
      "Clean brush with thin bristles",
      "Baking parchment",
      "Baking tray",
      "Drying rack",
    ],

    steps: [
      "Cut your pre-washed fabric to the size you want using pinking shears (to prevent fraying). A thin, fine-weave cotton is best, as it is easier to fold and wrap when infused with wax; muslin or sheet-thickness is ideal. The beeswax will turn your fabric slightly yellow, so choose a colour that won’t clash.",
      "Put the pine resin (if in chunks, roll it with a rolling pin to turn it to powder) in a metal bowl and place over a pan of simmering water. When the resin starts to melt, add the beeswax, almond or coconut oil and jojoba. When the ingredients have melted, mix together gently, keeping the pan on a low heat.",
      "Heat your oven to 140°C. Lay the fabric on a baking sheet covered with baking paper, making sure the paper is bigger than your fabric. If you’re making a large wrap, for storing bread for example, it’s okay to fold the fabric so it fits on your baking sheet. Place in the oven for two minutes to heat the fabric.",
      "Take the tray out of the oven and, working quickly, use your brush to paint the fabric with the beeswax mix. Return to the oven for a minute, then remove and brush again to ensure the wax is spread evenly all over the cotton. Use pegs or just drape the fabric on a rack to dry; it will take only minutes.",
      "Your wrap is then ready to use. Use the warmth of your hands to shape it around a bowl, jar or sandwich. Don’t use your wrap to cover raw fish, eggs or meat. Clean it with a cloth using cold-to-warm water – hot will melt the wax – and a little detergent; rinse and hang to dry. If it needs a refresh after a few months, place on a lined tray in a 140°C oven for three minutes. ",

    subtle:
      "For you over caffeinated coffee addicts out there, time to toss the coffee pods! Turn that vice into a virtue by making zero waste coffee.",
    supplies: [
      "Start by buying your coffee in bulk.  You can typically either grind right there at the store (we tried 3 stores before we found one with a grinder so it may take a bit of perseverance) or do it yourself at home for an ultra-fresh brew – guaranteed maximum deliciousness!",
    ],
    steps: [
      "To make the coffee itself, you can either use a glass / stainless steel french press, or an Italian Bialetti stovetop espresso maker. We personally LOVE the Bialetti, we’ve been using for years and love the routine of making it on the stove, is a special little morning routine! Once you’re finished, just toss the grounds into your compost bin or even directly in soil as a pH neutral fertilizer and natural pesticide. Worms love coffee grounds too!",

      "Just because you’ve gone zero waste and avoid plastic bottles with chemical based household cleaners, doesn’t mean you can’t keep your kitchen sparkly clean. ",
    supplies: [
      "To wash dishes, ditch the plastic bottle and switch to zero waste dish soap. Alternatively, you can opt for zero waste bulk soap, which you can now find at many grocery stores.",
    ],
    steps: [
      "Lastly, to keep countertops clean and bacteria free with a simple, all-purpose zero waste cleaner you can make out of just vinegar diluted with water. ",

    subtle:
      "You might be surprised by how easy and fast making your own cleaning products can be! Hubby and I are lazy people, so we are all about simple solutions, or else there is no way we would incorporate that into our daily lives. This dish soap can be made in only one minute if you use liquid castile soap. If you use bar soap, you will have to add 5-10 minutes of grating. Or you can always chop it into chunks and have your food processor take care of the rest.",
    supplies: [
      "EITHER 25-30g palm oil free castile bar soap (we use traditional olive oil soap) OR 170ml palm oil free liquid castile soap (all of Dr. Bronner’s castile soaps are unfortunately palm oil based) OR you can use up whatever bar soap you still have at home, but in that case please note that the dish soap might not be free from harmful substances anymore and please make sure to read the troubleshooting below!",
      "2 tsp baking soda",
      "600ml water",
      "3 drops of your favorite essential oil (optional)",
      "1 soap dispenser and maybe a jar for the surplus",
    ],
    steps: [
      "Lastly, to Grate the soap. We usually grate a huge bar while watching some TV show and keep the soap flakes in a jar for next time or other recipes. If you have a food processor, well, lucky you! You can just chop the bar into chunks and let your food processor do the shredding.",
      "Bring water to a boil. Turn off the stove, add the soap flakes. Stir with a spoon until the soap has dissolved. Let cool. Add baking soda when the mixture is still warm, but not so hot that you could not touch it. We like to let it cool down overnight.",
      "Shake before you transfer in into a soap dispenser. Also shake from time to time.",
      "Mix the castile soap with hot water (not so hot that you couldn’t touch it), add the baking soda and stir to combine.",
